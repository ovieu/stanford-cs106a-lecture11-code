Barack Hussein Obama II (/bəˈrɑːk huːˈseɪn oʊˈbɑːmə/
(About this sound listen);[1] born August 4, 1961) is
an American politician who served as the 44th President of
the United States from 2009 to 2017. The first African American
to assume the presidency, he was previously the junior United
States Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. He served
in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 until 2004.

Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after
the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state.
Raised largely in Hawaii, Obama also spent one year of his
childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia.
After graduating from Columbia University in New York
City in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago.
In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was
the first black president of the Harvard Law Review.

After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor,
and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School
from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms
in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the
U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with
his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic
National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election
to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president a year after
his campaign began and after a close primary campaign against
Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain
and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later,
Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, accepting
the award with the caveat that he felt there were others
"far more deserving of this honor than I."
